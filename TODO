improvements (some easy, some not):
ðŸ”§ recurrence:

precompute decay masks once per max_seq_len, cache them.

better: rewrite recurrence with implicit recurrence ala Mamba (SSM-style filtering), no full matrices.

best: use state-space kernel convolution.

ðŸ”§ moe:

add router noise + load balancing loss (e.g., GShard-style aux loss).

optionally use soft routing + sparse dropout.

track expert usage, penalize overuse.

ðŸ”§ serriform block:

too many pathways. try ablations:

conv-only

recurrence-only

moe-only

fusion of just two (e.g., conv + moe)

monitor FLOPs and runtime per block.

ðŸ”§ generation:

support past_key_values-style streaming for faster autoregressive use.

shift cache update to be in-place to reduce allocations.

ðŸ”§ training:

track gradient norms per-layer (e.g., for exploding grads).

plug in entropy-based loss term to encourage diversity in expert usage.

consider fused optimizer (like fused adamw or 8-bit optimizers if training large models)

ðŸ”§ modularity:

split serriform block into submodules that can be toggled.

give an arch_config.json or similar that toggles features like recurrence, moe, conv, ff etc.
